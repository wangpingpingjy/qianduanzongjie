This repository contains the code from the chapter 7 example of Ionic in Action. It includes a number of smaller examples for more advanced features when building mobile apps with Ionic.

Here are the primary things we do in this chapter.

* Setup and use SASS to build custom styles for Ionic
* Adapt the behavior and style of the app based on the platform
* Change the default configuration for Ionic
* Use gestures and events to create touch interactions
* How to store data and persist between sessions
* How to determine online status and listen when it changes
